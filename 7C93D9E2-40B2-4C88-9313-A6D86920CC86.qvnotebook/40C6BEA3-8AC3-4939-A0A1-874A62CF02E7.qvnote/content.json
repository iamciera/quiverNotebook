This includes cytoplasmic filaments in muscle cells, intracellular membranes, and extracellular fibres.\nOther kinds of stains\n\n[Cotton Blue 1](http://microbeonline.com/lactophenol-cotton-blue-lpcb-mounts-principle-staining-protocol/)\n[Cotton Blue 2](http://www.jorvet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/cotton_blue.pdf)\n\nKramer's technic - page 93 in the Book Insect Histology\n\n## Other\n\nChitinase only stain: [http://oto.sagepub.com/content/127/5/377.full.pdf+html](http://oto.sagepub.com/content/127/5/377.full.pdf+html)\n\nDavid Hughs Zombie Ant : \n\nThin sections of **1 Î¼m** for light microscopy were stained with methylene blue and thinning\n\nThat is REALLY thin slices. \n\n"
