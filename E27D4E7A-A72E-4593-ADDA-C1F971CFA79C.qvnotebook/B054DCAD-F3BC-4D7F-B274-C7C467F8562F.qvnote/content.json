What are the higher order TFBS aggregation patterns that correspond to enhancer expression patterning?\n  * Number of TFs within each enhancer (quantified by how many times each unique TF is present)\n  * Length between same and different types of TFs (homo-dimeric or hetero-dimeric)\n  * overlapping motifs = competitive binding by steric hindrance\n\n2. Are the constraints found conserved in Montium species?  How do the constraints converge between montium species?\n  * Define orthologous TFBS within enhancers between species\n  \n\n## Data Sources\n\n1.  **Bronski data**\n\n2.  **Kvon data** Downloaded all the enhancers on February 5, 2016.
