The measurements are directed by a few hypothesis. \n  \n1. *higher order binding*. TFBS aggregation patterning. Cooperative binding.\n  * Number of TFs within each enhancer (quantified by how many times each unique TF is present) \n  * Length between same and different types of TFs (homo-dimeric or hetero-dimeric factor, and overlapping motifs = competitive binding by steric hindrance)\n  * Biased arrangements of TFBS\n  \nBased on evidence that similar develpmental programs are enriched in the same TFBS.\n\nRelation between Promoter and enhancer. \n\n## Classification\n\n### enhnacer regions\n\nEach dataset can have a track region and when those regions overlapp they are given a score from 1 - 3 (or maybe each track can be valued in addition).  Only the reasons that have signifcant overlapp with all the tracks will they be used to classify what an \"enhancer\" is. \n\nFor Visualization:\nThe overlap will have an additional track, like \"conservation\" between data sets. This could be a [spider plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart).\n\n## Assumptions and further notes\n\n1. Montium species have similar expression patterns to *Drosophila melanogastor*. \n2. Kvon et al., 2014, found enrichment of motifs within developmental stages (expression patterning). "
