Which is usually either two problems 1. trying to merge different data types or 2. the values didn't match. \n\nFor 1. you just print out the dataframe.info() and make sure that the merging column is the same dtype.\n\nFor 2. you look at the intersection between the two.  For example:\n`print dataFrame2.sequence.isin(dataFrame1.sequence) & dataFrame1.sequence.isin(dataFrame2.sequence)`\n\nIf there are no trues, then they don't match.  Turns out it was a white space issue in my case, in dataFrame1.\n\n`dataFrame1.sequence = [c.strip() for c in dataFrame1.sequence]`\n\n## Renaming\n\n## Reshaping / i.e Pivotting\n\nReshaping in pandas can be found here: [http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html)\n\n\n\n\n\n"
