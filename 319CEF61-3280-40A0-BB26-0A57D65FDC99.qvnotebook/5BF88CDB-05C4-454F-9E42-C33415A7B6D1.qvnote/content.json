So I re-quanitfied and got these results\n\n  -   D. birchii \n    -   65.9 ug/ml\n  -   D. bocki\n    -   19.4 ug/mL \n  - D. jambulina\n    -   24.7 ug/mL \n\nWhich is not that much different that what I got before.  So I am not sure. I need to read about how Quibit works exactly.\n\n**Problem 1**: This concentration  of the insert product is really low.  I think I lost too much in the gel extraction. I believe this could still be used for digestion, but I think I would lose too much after the next gel extraction. Do I need to be doing all these gel extractions in the PCR product pipeline? \n\nFrom [https://www.addgene.org/plasmid-protocols/pcr-cloning/](https://www.addgene.org/plasmid-protocols/pcr-cloning/)\n\n**Solution 1.1**: \n\n- [x] Run the PCR again and purify and use the entire PCR reaction See [PCR CM005](quiver-note-url/4CB7201C-ADE3-4957-9996-B37287A90B4F)\n\nRe-ran PCR, purified, and quantified and got:\n\n    -   D. birchii \n      -   462 ug/ml (ng/ul)\n    -   D. bocki \n      -   577 ug/mL (ng/ul)\n    - D. jambulina\n      -   251 ug/mL (ug/ul)\n      \nLooks like this is much better, but I am still going to run the entire PCR product for my DNA digestion.\n\n## Preparing Backbone\n\n- [x] Quantify Augusto's stock\n    - 389 ng/ul (.389 ug/ul)\n\n- [x] Propogate more of Augusto's stock\n    - [x]  Purify the product \n    - [x]  Quantify the product\n\n## Digestion \n\nSet up restriction digests for your PCR product and recipient plasmid. Because you lose some DNA during the gel purification step, it is important to digest plenty of starting material. We recommend using your entire PCR reaction and 1Î¼g of recipient plasmid. It is also critical that as much of the recipient plasmid as possible be cut with both enzymes, therefore it is important that the digest goes at least 4 hours and as long as overnight.\n\n- [x] Run digestion of insert using Not1-HF and Bam-HF - [Double digestion protocol](https://www.protocols.io/view/Single-temperature-Double-Digest-imsuj5)\n\nI did not gel purify, but did purfiy using the the kit. I eluted in only 7ul.  \n\n- [x] Run digestion of backbone using Not1 and Bam-HI \n\n![Screen Shot 2016-08-26 at 3.43.06 PM.png](quiver-image-url/823762E3A4EDAD425EA76F848DD6FD11.png)\n\n**Problem #2**\n\nIn the digestion of backbone using Not1 and Bam-HI, I could not see the 263bp insert from the double digestion. The other thing though is in the ladder I could not see the 200 bp ladder, so the band could be there...  It could be that the digest only worked for one of them and I am left with a linearized product. I cut the band that is around 12,000bp, but I am not sure if the double digest worked. \n\n**Solution #2.1** \n\nGoing to go ahead and purify the band. Maybe I should run the digest one more time. Run with the control AND put ethiidme bromide in the SB so I can see the 200bp region.\n\n- [x] Run gel 1.uncut insert, 2. cut insert 3. cut vector.\n- [x] Gel purify cut insert and cut vector\n- [x] Quantify\n\n  -  1. 212 ug/ml (ng/ul)\n  -  2. 65 ug/ml  (ug/ul)\n  -  3. 73.2 ug/ml (ug/ul)\n\n![Screen Shot 2016-08-26 at 3.43.14 PM.png](quiver-image-url/7D2713A4363093D305749EBEE47C0442.png)\n\n### Verfication of digestion\n\n![Screen Shot 2016-08-15 at 4.49.31 PM.png](quiver-image-url/DC6E222E55269B6578BF2DED53E5760E.png)\nFor a better explanation of running out and verifying your plasmid see [here](http://blog.addgene.org/plasmids-101-how-to-verify-your-plasmid)\n\n### Digestion of Inserts\n\nI used the entire PCR product after it was cleaned and eluted in 20 ul of water.\n\nEach digestion looked like this\n\n| 50ul | reagent |\n|------|---------|\n| 5    | buffer  |\n| 1    |NotI-HF  | \n| 1    |Bam-HF   | \n| 20   | DNA     |\n| 23   | H2o     | \n\n\n\n## Ligation - D. birchii\n\n- For each ligation, set up two different concentrations. See [here](https://www.k-state.edu/hermanlab/protocols/Ligations.html)\n- Make sure you include a negative control with no insert added. This will allow you to\n determine how many colonies you should expect in the transformation due to background re-circularization and contamination from uncut plasmid.\n\nUsing LigaFast T4 DNA Ligation System.  I ligated 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 contruct: fragement. Details can be found in the file `ligation_26Aug2016.xlxs`.  Pic below:\n\n![Screen Shot 2016-08-28 at 9.55.57 AM.png](quiver-image-url/4073C877779B14549338B85085B1309A.png)\n\n- I ligated for three hours, which only should have been 15 minutes since I was using the fast ligase.\n- Plated on Amp plates at 37c overnight. \n- The plates had no colonies.  Except for like 5 colonies amoungst the 10 plates. \n\n**Problem #3**\n\nThe ligation did not work.\n\n**Solution 3.1**\n\n**Possible Problem, you may have not added enough bases after the restriction site**. More information [here](https://www.neb.com/faqs/2016/04/07/how-many-nucletotides-do-i-have-to-add-adjacent-to-the-re-recognition-site-in-order-to-get-effici).  For one side I do, but for the other I don't.\n\n- [x] Design new primers. \n- [ ] Topo clone the undigested product and then digest. This way you can know for sure because there will be two clear bands.  (not needed)\n\nI designed new primers.  Got bands in all three species.  See PCR CM008.  I added all the products of both the D. jambulina and D. birchii and purified using the kit. I then went ahead and performed the digestion and purfied again after.  \n\nI looked at the DNA concentration of D. birchii and it was 690 ng/ul. I did not look at the concentration of D. jambuina, but prob should have. I diluted by 10 which is 690/15 = 46 ng/ul.\n\nLigation: Start with D. birchii\n\n![Screen Shot 2016-09-01 at 2.59.15 PM.png](quiver-image-url/7EFE1A31B10615621D43DB9B8D43ACF0.png)\nI am going to go ahead with 3:1, 7:1.\n\nD. birchii\n\n3:1        | 100ng vector (.5ul 212ng/ul sample) | 19.01ng insert (.5ul 46 ng/ul)\n7:1        | 100ng vector (.5ul 212ng/ul sample) | 44.92ng insert (1ul  46 ng/ul)\n14:1 (ish) | 100ng vector (.5ul 212ng/ul sample) | 90ng insert (2ul  46 ng/ul)\n\nD. bocki\n\n3:1        | 100ng vector (.5ul 212ng/ul sample) | 19.01ng insert (.75ul 26.4 ng/ul)\n7:1        | 100ng vector (.5ul 212ng/ul sample) | 44.92ng insert (1.5ul  26.4 ng/ul)\n14:1 (ish) | 100ng vector (.5ul 212ng/ul sample) | 90ng insert (3ul  26.4 ng/ul)\n\nD. jambulina\n\n3:1        | 100ng vector (.5ul 212ng/ul sample) | 19.01ng insert (.75ul 33 ng/ul)\n7:1        | 100ng vector (.5ul 212ng/ul sample) | 44.92ng insert (1.5ul  33 ng/ul)\n14:1 (ish) | 100ng vector (.5ul 212ng/ul sample) | 90ng insert (3ul  33 ng/ul)\n\n\n**Solution 3.1 - Results** \n\nWorked. I grew colonies on CAM plates, in which many colonies grew. I then grew in LB overnight at 37 and this PCR is testing the LB broth for prescence of the birchii region. The primers flank the construct and through the end of the insert. See [PCR CM010](quiver-note-url/77D040C0-E224-4518-A178-015E7BB01336) for details.\n\n**Solution 3.2**\n\n- [ ] Gibson Assembly - not needed because solution 1 worked, but for the future, I should use Gibson it is awesome. \n\n## Ligation - D. bockii and D. jambulina\n\n\n\n\n\n## Links\n\n[Brief introduction of designing enzymes](https://www.addgene.org/plasmid-protocols/subcloning/)\n[Guide to Handling Constructs](https://www.addgene.org/recipient-instructions/myplasmid/)"
