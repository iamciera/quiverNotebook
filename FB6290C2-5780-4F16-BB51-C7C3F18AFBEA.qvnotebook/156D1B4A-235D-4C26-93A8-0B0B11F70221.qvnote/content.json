Concentration 199 ng/ul. \n\n## Construct\n\nConstruct is the Emilia ES2 construct from Augusto digested by Bam-HF and NotI-HF. The concentration of the tube was 74 ng ul.\n\n## Reaction\n\n| reagent | ul   |\n|---------|------|\n| insert  | 2    | \n|construct| 1    |\n| Gibson  | 5    | \n| water   | 2    |\n\nGrown at 30c for 30 hours. \n\n## Colonies - YES\n\nCarb antibotic.\nGrown at 30c shaker for 30 hours, 10 were tested for presence.  **#8** was grown in 100 ml LB.
