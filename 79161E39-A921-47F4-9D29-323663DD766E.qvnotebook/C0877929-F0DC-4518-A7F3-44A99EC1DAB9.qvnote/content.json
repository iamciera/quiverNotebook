Any excess squishing buffer + Proteinase K must be discarded at the end of the day.  \rProcedure:\r1.\tMash each fly for 5 - 10 seconds with a pipette tip containing 50 µl of squishing buffer without depressing the pipette plunger (sufficient liquid escapes from the tip). \r2.\tExpel the remaining squishing buffer into fly mixture.\r3.\tIncubate at 25-37 °C (or room temp.) for 20-30 minutes.\r4.\tInactivate the Proteinase K by heating to 95 °C for 1-2 minutes.\r\r## Notes:\r•\tThe preparation can be stored at 4 °C for months.  \r•\tTypically, 1 µl of the DNA prep is used in a 10-15 µl reaction volume.  \r•\tIt does not matter if fly parts (wings, bristles, legs) are inadvertently added to the PCR mixture. \r•\tProduct will typically start to appear after 24-25 cycles, but 28-30 cycles seems to give maximal yield. \r•\tIncreasing the number of flies does not seem to increase the signal significantly, probably due to increasing concentrations of inhibitors.   \r•\tThere should be no problem scaling up the number of flies screened if the volume is increased proportionately.\r"
