Details of primer design are outlines in `Single_enhancers/Designing_primers_evenskipped2` notebook. \n\n## DNA Extraction\n\nExtracted using Alli's protocol. Only one fly per DNA extraction. In the protocol it said to use 50 ul of Squish Buffer (SB), but I used 90 ul for _D. sumulan_, _D. sechellia_, and _D. virilis_. For _D. melanogaster_ I used 50 ul. The DNA might be too dilute in the ones where I used 90 ul.\n\n## Samples \n\n1. _D. melanogaster_\n2. _D. simulan_\n3. _D. sechellia_\n4. _D. virilis_\n5. blank\n\n## Tube Assignments andPrimers\n\nTrying out each pairing to see if they work on each species to see if I get any signal.\n\nAll  DP\\_evenskipped2_.  Repeated through the five samples.\n\nA. (1-5):    F1 + R1\nB. (6-10):   F1 + R2\nC. (11-15):  F1 + R3\nD. (16-20):  F2 + R1\nE. (21-25):  F2 + R2\nF. (26-30):  F2 + R3 \n\n## PCR Conditions\n\nRepeat Steps 2 - 4: 35X\n\nRepeat Steps 2 - 4: 35X\n\n| step | temp |  time  |\n|------|------|--------|\n| 1    | 95   | 30 sec |\n| 2    | 95   | 15 sec |\n| 3    | 57   | 1 min  |\n| 4    | 72   | 2 min  |\n| 5    | 72   | 1 min  |\n| 6    | 4    | hold   |\n\n## Notes\n\n- Blank might not be blank for reaction #5 and #10, may be trace amounts of DNA amplified from pipetting error.\n- When loading the reaction I may have loaded reaction 6 in lane 5.\n- Used 90ul of Squish buffer instead of 50ul for all species but *D. melanogastor*.\n \n## Results\n\n![2016-03-07_cm01a.png](quiver-image-url/B467378B150CD5951B9043750C574985.png)\n![2016-03-07_cm01b.png](quiver-image-url/7CCDA127A81A81252BD2C24130B71CD3.png)\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\n1. ** One set of primers Work** Looks like primers F1 and R1 work extremeley well.  This is the best since they were amplifying the largest region.  I have to check the ladder, but it looks like.\n2. **DNA extraction method works really well for all species**\n\n## Next\n\n- [ ] Check and make sure the size makes sense 1,300 BP for the first three species and ~ 1,600 BP for _D. virilis_.\n- [ ] Do these primers work on more species?  Run Carolyn's samples\n- [ ] Try to design an even longer primer region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
