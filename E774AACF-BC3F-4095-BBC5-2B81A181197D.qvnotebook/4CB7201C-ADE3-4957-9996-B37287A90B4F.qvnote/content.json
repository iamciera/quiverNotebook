I think I lost too much DNA to run a successful ligation then gel purification of the material (after ligation).  This PCR is going to make more of the ES2 insert so I can properly run the digest and further gel purfy for ligation. \n\n## DNA \n\nUsed the DNA the was extracted August 15, 2016.\n\n## Samples\n\nPrimers: `Dbir_ES2_F1_cm` and `Dbir_ES2_R1_cm`\nNote: I think I used D. birchii ES2 PCR product from PCR CM004 as the DNA in these three so I did it again (10, 11, and 12), not sure why they all didn't work though.\n\n1.)

I am going to pool all (except the first three) and purify all three of each species together to hopefully yield enough DNA. Purification using DNA Clean and Concentrator by Zymo Reasearch.\n\n\n\n"
