More information in [eve locus](quiver-note-url/3E5FE202-7F6E-41DE-AB96-518E4A78AE7E).\n\n## DNA extraction \n\nI used the genomic DNA extract method given to me from Allie. It is based off the Qiagen Gentra Puregene Handbook for purification of archive quality DNA using the \"tissue\" protocol. Extracted on August 15, 2016.\n\n### PCR CM004 birch\n\nDNA: _Drosophila birchii_ \nPrimers: `Dbir_ES2_F1_cm` and `Dbir_ES2_R1_cm`\n\n### PCR CM004 bock\n\nDNA: _Drosophila bocki_ \nPrimers: `Dboc_ES2_F1_cm` and `Dbir_ES2_R1_cm`\n\n### PCR CM004 jam\n\nDNA: _Drosophila jambulina_ \nPrimers: `Druf_ES2_F1_cm` and `Dbir_ES2_R1_cm`\n\n## PCR Set-up \n\nUsed Phusion High Fidelity DNA Polymerase Protocol for a routine PCR\n\n9 Samples\n\n### Per Sample\n\n- 5x Phusion HF: 5 ul\n- 10 mM dNTPs: 0.5 ul\n- 10 uM Forward Primer: 1.25 ul\n- 10 uM Reverse Primer: 1.25 ul\n- DNA: 1ul\n- Phusion Polymerase: 0.25 ul\n- Water: 15.75\n\n## Program - Gradient\n\n| step | temp       |  time  |\n|------|------------|--------|\n| 1    | 95         | 30 sec |\n| 2    | 95         | 15 sec |\n| 3    | Gradient   | 1 min  |\n| 4    | 72         | 2 min  |\n| 5    | 72         | 1 min  |\n| 6    | 4          | hold   |\n\nRepeat Steps 2 - 4: 30X\n\n###Step 3 Temp\n\n1. 55.3\n2. 56.4\n3. 57.7\n4. 59.2\n5. 60.8\n6. 62.3\n7. 63.6\n8. 64.8\n\n## Results\n\n![Screen Shot 2016-08-16 at 12.56.27 PM.png](quiver-image-url/C8103B61265404F52A6C435B4DF7BFDA.png)\n\n## Conclusions and Next\n\nThe correct band is there right above the 800 bp line in the ladder. Perfect they are all about 824bp.  Yay! Looks like the highest temperture could go even higher.  Birchii can certainly go higher and should. Bocki works well on the highest although there is some smearing and Jambulina is perfect at all tempertures. I think to make sure that I have the right sequence I am going to combine like three of the best tempertures, gel extract and purify.  Then maybe it would be best to clone? Just to make sure????\n\n\n"
